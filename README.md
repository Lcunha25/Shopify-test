# Shopify-test

## This is a test for a sign-up page on Shopify using SCSS, HTML5 and JavaScript.
### This has been tested with no issues on "google chrome", "mozilla firefox", "opera", and "safari".

# Identified bugs
## Small triangle not clicking
### Fontawesome image is in front of section tag. Because of that there is a small area that will not be clicked inside the section div.
## Letters inside section tag.
### I have identified that the letters inside the sections tag, when in very small screens, are too close to the reversed arrow. That can cause confusion to users and should be addressed.
